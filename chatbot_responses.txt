Q8: Explain the concept of Fundamental Rights and their limitations.
A8: Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution are a set of rights that are guaranteed to all citizens, ensuring their freedom and equality. These rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and include various freedoms such as the right to freedom of speech and expression, the right to assemble peacefully, the right to form associations, and the right to move freely throughout the territory of India, among others.

However, these rights are not absolute and come with certain limitations. According to Article 19(2) of the Indian Constitution, the right to freedom of speech and expression, for example, can be restricted by the State through laws that impose reasonable restrictions in the interests of:

1. Sovereignty and integrity of India
2. Security of the State
3. Friendly relations with foreign States
4. Public order
5. Decency or morality
6. Contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to an offence

Additionally, Article 13 of the Constitution states that any law made by the State that takes away or abridges the rights conferred by the Fundamental Rights is void to the extent of such contravention. This means that while citizens have guaranteed rights, the State can impose reasonable restrictions to maintain order and protect the interests of society.
